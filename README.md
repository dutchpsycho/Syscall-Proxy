## Project Overview  

**Syscall Proxy** is an open-source research project developed by **TITAN Softwork Solutions** with inspiration from [MDSEC](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/), SysWhisperer & Hellsgate.  

This implements a stub-based internal syscall dispatcher which bypasses all usermode hooks and sidesteps lower level kernel API's (EDR/AC/AV evasion tech)

This project is powered by **ActiveBreach**, a dedicated syscall execution we built framework that:
- Dynamically extracts **system service numbers (SSNs)** from `ntdll.dll`
- Constructs **syscall stubs** for direct execution
- Uses a **dispatcher model** to invoke syscalls without routing through user-mode APIs
- Leverages a **callback** to prevent debugging.

For a deeper technical breakdown on why, see > [TECH.md](TECH.md).

# Bypasses 🔑

## **Driverless**  

| **Bypass**                                      | **Description**                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Global hooks on `ntdll.dll`**                 | Reads `ntdll.dll` directly into buffer, bypassing any API's monitoring lib loading.    |
| **Remote process `ntdll.dll` hooks**            | Uses internal ActiveBreach dispatcher instead of calling hooked `ntdll.dll` directly.  |
| **Partial YARA/CADA evasion**                   | Minimizes `ntdll.dll` presence in memory by zeroing out portions.                      |

## **Kernel Driver**  

| **Sidestep**                       | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine**    | Loads `ntdll.dll` manually, avoiding kernel notifications (`PsApi`).        |
| **MmLoadSystemImage**              | Maps `ntdll.dll` manually, preventing system image load tracking.           |


### **Normal hooked API call**
```
User Process
    │
    ├──▶ CreateFile (Wrapper, kernel32.dll)
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │    NtCreateFile (ntdll.dll)   <─── [Hooked by AntiVirus/AntiCheat]
    │         │ 
    │         ▼
    │   [Hook Handler]  <─── (Monitoring, logging, blocking, etc...)
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │  Kernel (Syscall)  <─── (Actual system call after handling)
    │ 
    ▼ 
  Return 
```

### **ActiveBreach API call**
```
User Process
    │
    ├──▶ ab_call("NtCreateFile")  <─── (Not using "CreateFile" as ActiveBreach only supports Nt functions)
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │  Kernel (Syscall)  <─── (Direct system call without passing through `ntdll.dll`)
    │ 
    ▼ 
  Return
```

# **Using ActiveBreach (C & C++)**

---

## ActiveBreach Usage

### 1. Include the Appropriate Header
- **C++ Projects:**  
  Include `ActiveBreach.hpp` and link with `ActiveBreach.cpp`:
  ```cpp
  #include <ActiveBreach.hpp>
  ```
- **C/C++ Universal Projects:**  
  Include `ActiveBreach.h` and link with `ActiveBreach.c`:
  ```c
  #include "ActiveBreach.h"
  ```

### 2. Initialize ActiveBreach
Call the initialization function **before** any syscalls:
- **C++ Example (optional "LMK" prints a status message):**
  ```cpp
  ActiveBreach_launch("LMK");
  ```
- **C/C++ Example:**
  ```c
  ActiveBreach_launch();
  ```
This function maps `ntdll.dll`, extracts syscall numbers, builds syscall stubs, and sets up the system.

### 3. Making a System Call
Use the `ab_call` macro to invoke syscalls dynamically. You must supply:
- The NT function type
- The syscall name
- The required arguments

**Example for NtQuerySystemInformation:**
```cpp
NTSTATUS status;
status = ab_call(NtQuerySystemInformation_t, "NtQuerySystemInformation", infoClass, buffer, bufferSize, &returnLength);
```
*(For C, the syntax is similar but might pass the status as an additional parameter.)*

### 4. Cleanup
No manual cleanup is needed—resources are automatically released at program exit.

<br>

## Requirements:
- Win11/10, x64
- MSVC, C++ 17/20

### Compiling
1. Open `ActiveBreach.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution
